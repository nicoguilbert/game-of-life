# game-of-life
A very small implementation of Conway's Game of Life with Python3 and Tkinter module

# Set up
This code has been tested with python 3 on Debian and Ubuntu. For some reason I couldn't install Tkinter on Fedora.

You will need to download Numpy and Tkinter modules for Python 3.

    pip install numpy
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    
    python3 life.py
